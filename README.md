# randomforest
## project title
Classify the random_forest algorithm using  skit learn classifier "random_forest" classifier for "iris.scv" and predict the datahow many species are interconnected with nth Decsion tree node.
## TASK
1. import the random_forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble librarie.
2. Load your data  using seaborn graphics librarie as a argument load_iris().
3. prepreoces the data using skitlearn graphic libarie.
4. select the model using "model_selection" from sns as a seaborn and sklearn as a skitlearn machine learning libarie
5. load iris.csv dataset for data as a input variable and target as a functinable output variable.
6. choose the train and test data using argumental librarie train_test_split.
7. select the estimators as a nth Decision tree.
8. use a random_forest classifier and quit your model.
9. find out your model accuracy

#conclusion
model as approach 1.00 accuracy,which lies between in the range of 0-1.

Hence it is shows thst random_forest Desicion succesfully.
